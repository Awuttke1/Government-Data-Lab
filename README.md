  I chose this dataset because I am interested in school safety, especially in light of the recent shootings that have been happening all over the country. I think it may be interested in looking into the correlation between school safety and standardized testing score from different schools. I choose this specific part of the dataset because I liked how they organized the data by how **often** there was ethnic or racial based violence. The frequency chart shows that most chools report ethnic or racial based violence happening at least occasionally. Many schools  also report that there is never any racial/ethnic violence, which i doubt (instead i believe the administrators are not aware of it).
